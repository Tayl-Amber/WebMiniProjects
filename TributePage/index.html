        Alan Mathison Turing was a British mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst, and computer scientist. He was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalization of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer.

        Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. During World War II, he played a crucial role in breaking the German Enigma code, leading to Allied victory in the Atlantic. Despite his significant contributions, Turing was persecuted for his homosexuality and tragically died by suicide in 1954.

        In 2009, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown issued an official apology on behalf of the British government for "the appalling way he was treated." Turing was posthumously pardoned in 2013, and in 2021, he was featured on the new Â£50 note issued by the Bank of England, recognizing his immense contributions to science and society.
